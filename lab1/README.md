# Lab #1

This is the lab1 assignment for Group 1. It includes our team page and each members resume.

### Courteney

For Lab #1, our group worked together on our group portfolio website. I specifically worked on the Previous Works page. Since I haven't worked with HTML/CSS in a while I got stuck while working with the flexnbox and the correct syntax to center the div. To troubleshoot I researched documentation from W3Schools (https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp) to find the correct orientation. I also had to refer to some CSS documentation as I forgot how to do minor things such as making text bold and underlining.

### Priscilla

For this lab, we worked together as a team to create our group portfilio. We were able to effectively split up different pages of the website to efficiently complete this assignment. Nicole worked on the landing page, Courteney worked on the previous works page, Dana worked on the meet the team page, and I worked on the resume format page. We wanted the CSS of the resume page to match each others' and match the theme of the group portfolio website. I was able to complete most of the page using my knowledge of HTML and CSS from the Intro to ITWS class from last year. However, I had to search up some documentation on CSS formating, such as using flexboxes. Additionally, the team and I did not know what microformats were, so we had to do some research together to implement this on the resume format page.
