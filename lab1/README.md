# Lab #1

This is the lab1 assignment for Group 2. It includes our team page and each members resume.

### Courteney

For Lab #1, our group worked together on our group portfolio website. I specifically worked on the Previous Works page. Since I haven't worked with HTML/CSS in a while I got stuck while working with the flexnbox and the correct syntax to center the div. To troubleshoot I researched documentation from W3Schools (https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp) to find the correct orientation. I also had to refer to some CSS documentation as I forgot how to do minor things such as making text bold and underlining.

### Dana
I worked on the Team page for this lab that includes each person's name, major, year, professional headshot, and a link to their resume page. Validating my HTML and CSS files 
helped me catch a lot of my syntax errors, making my code aligned with the typical HTML/CSS standards and the rest of my team. I also ran into some merge conflicts so I had to
refresh my memory on how to resolve them. The team collaborated well together overall.
