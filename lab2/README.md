### Courteney

In Lab 2, we were assigned to make a website with Amendments I-X and Articles I-VII. We were also told to analyze each amendment and article using our own opinions. I worked on Articles 1 and 5 and Amendments 2-6. I also worked on the HTML and CSS formatting for the Amendments and Articles page. I got stuck with the formatting specifically trying to align the analysis with each amendment/article. To troubleshoot this problem, I did some reasearch and found the grid module which helped me align these text boxes.
