                Before any constitution was drafted, the American colonies were governed under charters by Britain. 
                They became increasingly resentful of British control and declared themselves free states in 1776. 
                They created the Articles of Confederation as the US’s first governing framework, which was in effect 
                from 1781 to 1789. It established a weak central government with most power given to the 13 sovereign 
                states. However, some limitations, like the inability to tax or enforce laws, led to financial instability 
                and state disputes. A stronger US Constitution was ultimately needed to replace it. Delegates from 12 of the
                13 states met in Philadelphia from May - September 1787 to revise the Articles of Confederation; this is known 
                as the Constitutional Convention, which quickly escalated to a full rewrite.

                    Key issues were debated at the convention: how states would be represented in the new government, the role 
                of slavery, the power of the executive branch, and the balance between state and federal authority. Larger 
                states wanted to be represented by their population, whereas smaller states wanted to be represented equally; 
                this led to the House of Representatives being based on state population and the Senate granting equal 
                representation to each state. Slavery was addressed through the Three-Fifths compromise, stating that enslaved 
                individuals counted as three-fifths of a person and that the slave trade could not be banned until 1808. The 
                president was also designed at the convention and was granted this position significant powers that were subject 
                to checks and balances through Congress and the judiciary. The final draft was signed on September 17, 1787. 
                The Federalists, who supported the ratification of the Constitution, won support through the promise of a Bill 
                of Rights, which was adopted in 1791 as the first ten amendments.

                Today, the Constitution is considered a “living document” and continues to change based on amendments, court 
                rulings, and political debate. The separation of powers and division of authority between states and the national 
                government has allowed the Constitution to be the longest-lasting written constitution in the world.
