            <span class="highlight">The right of the people to be secure</span> in 
            their persons, houses, papers, and effects, <span class="highlight">against 
            unreasonable searches and seizures</span>, shall not be violated, and no

            affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the 
            persons or things to be seized.

        <p>
            The Fourth Amendment is the protection against unreasonable searches. 
            It requires that warrants be issued only with probable cause. This is 
            crucial for protecting individuals from government overreach. It ensures 
            personal space, both in the physical and digital world. For example, this 
            is seen in modern ruling on cell phone searches. This amendment ensures 
            a balance between public safety and individual liberty.

        <p>
            The Eighth Amendment ensures that a person's freedom before trial is not 
            determined by their ability to pay. The first clause, “excessive bail 
            shall not be required,” protects people who have been accused but not yet 
            convicted of a crime. The second clause, “nor cruel and unusual punishments 
            inflicted,” refers to the debate over the death penalty or other forms of 
            punishment. This amendment continuously checks on the power of the state to 
            punish citizens to ensure that the punishment fits the crime.
