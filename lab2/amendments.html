          The First Amendment protects the freedom of religion, protecting
          religious practice and preventing government establishment of
          religion; freedom of speech; freedom of the press; the right to
          peaceably assemble; and the right to petition the government. This
          amendment protects US citizens' rights to express their opinions and
          practice their faith. In my opinion, this is one of the foundations of the US
          and what makes this country so diverse with great ideas.

          The Second Amendment states that people have the right to own and
          carry weapons.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Second Amendment is a highly controverisal topic because some
          people focus on the need for a militia, while others focus on the
          individual right to own guns. I believe that people should have the
          right to own guns, but there should be stricter regulations to ensure
          public safety.

          The Fourth Amendment is the protection against unreasonable searches.
          It requires that warrants be issued only with probable cause. This is
          crucial for protecting individuals from government overreach. It
          ensures personal space, both in the physical and digital world. For
          example, this is seen in modern ruling on cell phone searches. This
          amendment ensures a balance between public safety and individual
          liberty. I believe that this amendment continues to stay relevant 
          today and is even more important as technology advances.

        <p>
          The Fifth Amendment gives citizens protection in legal proceedings. It
          gives them the right to a grand jury indictment for serious crimes,
          protection against being tried twice for the same crime, “pleading the
          fifth,” the right to due process of law, and the requirement for just
          compensation if private property is taken for public use. This
          protects individuals from unfair legal proceedings and limits the
          government's power. “Pleading the Fifth” is a common phrase that
          allows a person to remain silent to avoid self-incrimination. I liked learning
          about what "Pleading the Fifth" meant. I didn't know this previously and am glad
          this lab exposed me to it.

        <p>
          In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy
          <span class="highlight"
            >the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the
            State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed</span
          >, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and
          to
          <span class="highlight"
            >be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be
            confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory
            process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the
            Assistance of Counsel for his defence.</span

      <div class="amendment">
        <h3 id="analysis6" class="amendment-header">Analysis</h3>
        <div class="spacing"></div>
        <p>
          The Sixth Amendment gives the accused criminal the right to a speedy,
          public trial by an impartial jury in the area where the crime
          happened. They must be told what they are charged with, can face the
          witnesses against them, bring in witnesses to support them, and have a
          lawyer to defend them.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think the Sixth Amendment is fair because it ensures that anyone
          accused of a crime gets a clear, timely, and unbiased trial, along
          with the help of a lawyer and the chance to defend themselves. This is
          especially important for people who might not be able to afford a
          lawyer on their own.

          <span class="highlight">Excessive bail shall not be required</span>,

      <div class="amendment">
        <h3 id="analysis8" class="amendment-header">Analysis</h3>
        <div class="spacing"></div>
        <p>
          The Eighth Amendment ensures that a person's freedom before trial is
          not determined by their ability to pay. The first clause, “excessive
          bail shall not be required,” protects people who have been accused but
          not yet convicted of a crime. The second clause, “nor cruel and
          unusual punishments inflicted,” refers to the debate over the death
          penalty or other forms of punishment. This amendment continuously
          checks on the power of the state to punish citizens to ensure that the
          punishment fits the crime.  I feel that this amendment is fair because 
          it reflects the society's standard of justice.

          <span class="highlight">The enumeration</span> in the Constitution, of
          certain rights, <span class="highlight">shall not</span> be construed
          to deny or

            >disparage others retained by the people.</span

        <h3 id="analysis9" class="amendment-header">Analysis</h3>
        <div class="spacing"></div>
        <p>
          The Ninth Amendment acknowledges the existence of rights that citizens
          have that are not explicitly listed in the document. It addresses the
          concern that any rights not written in the Constitution are not
          protected and prevents the federal government from claiming powers not
          delegated to it. I think this Amendment is crucial to add; if we only
          had the rights listed in the Constituition, we would be very limited in
          our day to day life.
