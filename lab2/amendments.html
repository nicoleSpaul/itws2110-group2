            The First Amendment protects the freedom of religion, protecting 
            religious practice and preventing government establishment of religion; 
            freedom of speech; freedom of the press; the right to peaceably assemble; 
            and the right to petition the government. This amendment protects US 
            citizens’ rights to express their opinions and practice their faith.

            <span class="highlight">The right of the people to be secure</span> in

            persons or things to be seized.

        <p>
            The Fourth Amendment is the protection against unreasonable searches. 
            It requires that warrants be issued only with probable cause. This is 
            crucial for protecting individuals from government overreach. It ensures 
            personal space, both in the physical and digital world. For example, this 
            is seen in modern ruling on cell phone searches. This amendment ensures 
            a balance between public safety and individual liberty.

        <p>
            The Fifth Amendment gives citizens protection in legal proceedings. 
            It gives them the right to a grand jury indictment for serious crimes, 
            protection against being tried twice for the same crime, “pleading the 
            fifth,” the right to due process of law, and the requirement for just 
            compensation if private property is taken for public use. This protects 
            individuals from unfair legal proceedings and limits the government’s 
            power. “Pleading the Fifth” is a common phrase that allows a person to 
            remain silent to avoid self-incrimination.

        <p>
            <span class="highlight">Excessive bail shall not be required</span>,

        <div class="spacing"></div>
        <p>
            The Eighth Amendment ensures that a person's freedom before trial is not 
            determined by their ability to pay. The first clause, “excessive bail 
            shall not be required,” protects people who have been accused but not yet 
            convicted of a crime. The second clause, “nor cruel and unusual punishments 
            inflicted,” refers to the debate over the death penalty or other forms of 
            punishment. This amendment continuously checks on the power of the state to 
            punish citizens to ensure that the punishment fits the crime.

        <p>
            <span class="highlight">The enumeration</span> in the Constitution, of certain rights, <span class="highlight">shall not</span> be construed to 
            deny or <span class="highlight">disparage others retained by the people.</span>

        <h3 id="analysis9" class="amendment-header">Analysis</h3>
        <div class="spacing"></div>
        <p>
            The Ninth Amendment acknowledges the existence of rights that citizens have that 
            are not explicitly listed in the document. It addresses the concern that 
            any rights not written in the Constitution are not protected and prevents 
            the federal government from claiming powers not delegated to it.
